The period was characterized by steady growth driven by increasing consumer preference for craft beer and home brewing. According to industry reports, the market grew at an annual CAGR of approximately 5.2% during these years. A notable trend during this period was the rise in demand for premium ingredients such as dry yeast, hops, malt extracts, and other adjuncts, largely due to the growing popularity of artisanal and craft beer production.</p> <p>In particular, dry yeast gained substantial traction as it offered convenience and efficiency to homebrewers, a segment that accounted for a large portion of the demand. Hops, which are integral to flavor, also saw increased demand, driven by the craft beer industry's shift towards hoppy, bitter flavors.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Shifting Dynamics: 2023 to 2033 Market Forecast</h2> <p>Looking ahead, the market for dry brewing ingredients is poised for dramatic shifts. From 2023 to 2033, factors such as sustainability, innovation, and a growing shift toward non-alcoholic and functional beverages are expected to alter demand patterns.
